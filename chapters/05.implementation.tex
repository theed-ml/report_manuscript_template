\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}

The \textbf{implementation} chapter is similar to the \textbf{specification \& design}. Therefore, it describes the system at a finer level of detail. This chapter is about the realization of the concepts and ideas presented in the previous ones. It can also describe any problems that may have arisen during the implementation and how the team dealt with them.

Please, do not attempt to describe all the code in the system, and do not include large pieces of code in this section. Instead pick out and describe just the pieces of code which, for example:

\begin{itemize}
	\item are especially critical to the operation of the system
	\item illustrate a non-standard or innovative way of handling a problem
\end{itemize}
