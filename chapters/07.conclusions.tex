\chapter{Conclusions \& Future Work}\label{ch:conclusion}

This chapter summarizes the aims of project and it restates its main results. In other words, it describes what has been learned and what has been achieved. An effective set of conclusions should not introduce new material. Instead it should briefly draw out, summarize, combine, and reiterate the main points that have been made in the body of the report and present opinions based on them.

It is quite likely that by the end of your project you will not have achieved all that you planned at the start; and in any case, your ideas will have grown during the course of the project beyond what you could hope to do within the available time.

This chapter finishes expressing the unrealized ideas. It is a way of stating what you would like to have done if only you had not run out of time. A good future work description should provide a starting point for someone else to continue the work which you have begun.
