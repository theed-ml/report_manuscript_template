\chapter{Proposed Approach}\label{ch:contribution}

Describe in reasonable detail the proposed approach you have used to address the problem. Give the pseudocode of the learning algorithm, including its general outline and the main equations. Trace through a concrete example of how the algorithm works. The example should be complex enough to illustrate all the essential aspects of the problem, but simple enough to be easily understood. If possible, an intuitively and meaningful example is better that one with meaningless symbols.
