\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

The \textbf{background section} aims to provide to reader the
information that they cannot be expected to know, but which they will
need to know in order to fully understand and appreciate the rest of the
report. This section usually describes things such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the wider context of the project
  \item the theory associated with the scope of the project
  \item the constraints on the approach to be adopted
  \item the methods and tools that the solution may be based on or use to solve the problem
\end{itemize}
